    A proxy model representing a Job in the system.

    This class extends the Job model and provides additional methods like 'unplug_bookkeeper_for_client_finished_job'
    to handle operations related to managing bookkeepers for finished jobs.

    Attributes:
        Managed Fields:
            - managed_by: The user who manages the job.
            - status: The status of the job (e.g., CON_COMPLETED, CON_ARCHIVED).
            - client: The client associated with the job.

    Methods:
        unplug_bookkeeper_for_client_finished_job(self):
            Method to unplug the bookkeeper for a finished job. It removes the bookkeeper associated with the job's manager
            from the client's bookkeeper list.
