    A custom manager for models with a soft delete feature.

    This manager provides methods for querying instances that are not marked as deleted.
    It also includes additional methods for random selection and filtering by status.

    Methods:
        get_queryset(self) -> BaseQuerySetMixin: Returns a `BaseQuerySetMixin` object representing all instances of the model that are not marked as deleted.
        all(self) -> BaseQuerySetMixin: Returns a `BaseQuerySetMixin` object representing all instances of the model with a status not in `ALLOWED_STATUS`.
        random(self) -> Model: Returns a random instance of the model that is not marked as deleted.

    Attributes:
        ALLOWED_STATUS (list): A list of status values that are considered allowed and not marked as deleted.
