class BaseModelMixin(DiffingMixin, GetModelInstanceAsDictMixin, models.Model):
    """
    A mixin class that provides common functionality for models in the Beachwood Wood
    Financial application.

    This mixin class includes fields and methods that are commonly used by models.

    Fields:
    - id: A UUID field that serves as the primary key for the model.
    - metadata: A JSONField that stores additional metadata for the model.
    - is_deleted: A Boolean field that indicates whether the model is deleted or not.
    - created_at: A DateTimeField that stores the timestamp when the model was created.
    - updated_at: A DateTimeField that stores the timestamp when the model was last updated.
    - deleted_at: A DateTimeField that stores the timestamp when the model was deleted (if applicable).

    Methods:
    - get_columns_names: A class method that returns the names of the columns for the model.
      It takes optional parameters `fields` and `excluded` to specify which fields to include or exclude from the column names.
    - soft_delete: A method that marks the model as deleted by setting the `is_deleted` field to `True` and recording the deletion timestamp.
    - hard_delete: A method that permanently deletes the model from the database by calling the `delete` method on the `original_objects` manager.
    - delete: A method that performs a soft delete by calling the `soft_delete` method.
    - restore: A method that restores a deleted model by setting the `is_deleted` field to `False` and clearing the deletion timestamp.

    The `BaseModelMixin` class also includes a `Meta` class with the following attributes:
    - abstract = True: This indicates that the `BaseModelMixin` class is intended to be used as a base class for other models and should not be instantiated directly.
    - permissions: A list of permission tuples that define the permissions available for the models using this mixin.
      The permissions include "can_view_list" and "view_archive".

    Overall, the `BaseModelMixin` class provides a foundation for models in the Beachwood Wood Financial application by defining common fields and methods,
    and specifying metadata and permissions.
