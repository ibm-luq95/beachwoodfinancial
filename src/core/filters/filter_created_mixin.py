class FilterCreatedMixin(HelpfulFilterSet):
    """
    A mixin class for filtering by created date.

    This mixin class provides a `created` filter field and a `created_between` filter field
    for filtering by the `created_at` field of a model. The `created` filter allows filtering
    by specific dates (e.g., "today", "this_week", "this_month") and the `created_between`
    filter allows filtering by a range of dates.

    Attributes:
        created (django_filters.ChoiceFilter): A filter field for filtering by specific dates.
        created_between (django_filters.DateFromToRangeFilter): A filter field for filtering
            by a range of dates.

    Methods:
        filter_created(self, queryset, name, value): A method for filtering by specific dates.
            It takes a queryset, a field name, and a value as input and returns a filtered queryset.
